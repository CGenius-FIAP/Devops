## üöÄüöÄ <a id="intro"></a>Introduction üöÄüöÄ

  We are proud to announce the 3rd Sprint of the 2023 FIAP + PLUSOFT Challenge. We aimed to deliver precisely what we were asked to: a new chatbot integrated with OpenAI's groundbreaking ChatGPT, trained toward a more focused area.

  Our project was to create a sales assistant capable of answering a wide range of questions, from stock availability to furniture dimensions, power consumption of a GPU, differences between newer and older generations of certain products, and more.

  Eventually, we plan to add features to complete purchases through the chatbot itself . But for now, we are focusing on core aspects of the project, such as cloud availability and code refactoring for improved performance and lower operation costs.

  We've just finished the core essentials of the system, and from now until Sprint 4, we intend to polish and improve the UI/UX for our customers. We will also enhance the training prompts given to GPT, as well as provide secure storage for conversation history and incorporate image displays in the chatbox for further immersion.

  Our main goal is to automate, to a certain extent, the adaptability of the chatbot, making it easier to create prompts so that it can be used in almost all types of businesses.

## üåüüåü <a id="benefits"></a> Benefits of Using Chatbots üåüüåü
Why Chatbots Are Transforming Customer Service:
1Ô∏è‚É£ üè¶ Cost-Efficiency: When compared to traditional customer support methods, chatbots offer significantly reduced operating costs. These digital agents are available 24/7, providing non-stop customer service that human agents can't possibly match. This leads to a lower overhead without sacrificing quality support.

2Ô∏è‚É£ üåç Global Availability: Their constant availability isn't just convenient‚Äîit's a game-changer for global business operations. Chatbots can accommodate customers in various time zones without the extra expense of overnight staffing, thus widening your global reach and enhancing customer experience.

3Ô∏è‚É£ üìà Scalability: Chatbots possess the incredible ability to handle multiple queries at once. This greatly reduces customer wait times and boosts overall efficiency. The result? Higher customer satisfaction rates and a more robust bottom line.

üëâ All of these advantages come at just a fraction of the cost of maintaining a full-scale, human customer service team, making chatbots an extraordinarily cost-effective solution for modern businesses.

üõë Considerations and Limitations üõë
üö´ Unnatural Conversations: It's worth noting that chatbots aren't perfect. Users have reported less-than-stellar interactions, citing unnatural conversation flows and sometimes even irrelevant responses, which can be a drawback both for customers and businesses.

üö´ Limited Creativity: While scripted bots offer a predefined set of responses, they lack the creative problem-solving capabilities of generative AI models. Although these advanced AI solutions may come at a higher cost, the results they deliver can often justify the investment.


Generative chatbots can eliminate every single one of it's most unliked aspect: lack of humanity. New-gen chatbot will be capable of answering detailed questions about the product, price, description, everything.

While at the beggining the cost of development of such marvels can be slightly higher than the traditional way, the return it can provide to companies is unfathomable; and in time, development costs will lower, as popularity increases.

## <a name="known-issues"></a>Known Issues üêõüîç

We appreciate your interest in our project and would like to keep you informed about some of the issues we are currently facing:

### Chatbot Memory Limitations ü§ñüß†
- **Issue**: The chatbot sometimes fails to remember the entire conversation history, especially when a client asks about multiple items consecutively.
- **Impact**: This limits the chatbot's ability to provide coherent and context-aware responses in ongoing conversations.
- **Status**: Under Investigation.

### Database Connection Issues on Azure Web App üåêüíæ
- **Issue**: The API, when hosted on Azure Web App, seems to work only for the first few minutes before the database starts refusing additional connections.
- **Impact**: This disrupts the functionality of the API after initial activation.
- **Possible Cause**: The Hibernate and JPA, which are supposed to manage and close database connections, may not be functioning as expected.
- **Status**: Under Investigation.

### Inefficient Azure Service Utilization üí∞üìà
- **Issue**: Multiple Azure services are currently being used where fewer could suffice, leading to unnecessary operational costs.
- **Impact**: Higher costs than necessary for maintaining the project, but not at an extreme level.
- **Status**: In the process of re-architecting to make the system more cost-efficient.
